# Cucumber API Steps

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gonzalo-bulnes/cucumber-api-steps.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gonzalo-bulnes/cucumber-api-steps)

Forked from [jayzes/cucumber-api-steps](https://github.com/jayzes/cucumber-api-steps).

A set of [Cucumber](https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber) step definitions utilizing
[Rack-Test](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test) that ease basic
testing of REST-style APIs using either XML or JSON formats.

Adapted from [a blog post by Anthony Eden](http://www.anthonyeden.com/2010/11/testing-rest-apis-with-cucumber-and-rack-test/) with a few additions based on my own needs.  I found myself copying these step definitions around to multiple projects, and decided that it would be worthwhile to gem them up to keep things nice and DRY.

## Dependencies

Requires [Cucumber](https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber) (obviously).  Also makes use of [JSONPath](https://github.com/joshbuddy/jsonpath) for setting criteria against JSON responses.  See the gemspec for more info.

## Installation

Add the following line to your Gemfile, preferably in the test or cucumber group:

    gem 'cucumber-api-steps', :require => false

Then add the following line to your env.rb to make the step definitions available in your features:

    require 'cucumber/api_steps'

# Usage

Still a work in progress.  For now, read the api_steps.rb file or check out the [stashboard-rails](https://github.com/jayzes/stashboard-rails) project - its Cucumber features make extensive use of the steps in this gem.

# Examples

    Feature: API

      Scenario: List tweets in JSON
        When I send and accept JSON
        And I send a GET request to "/api/tweets"
        Then the response status should be "200"
        And the JSON response should be:
          """
          [{"tweet":"Hello World!"},{"tweet":"New Rails has been released"}]
          """
        And the JSON response should have "$..tweet" with the text "Hello World!"
        And the JSON response should have "$..tweet" with a length of 2

      Scenario: List tweets in XML
        When I send and accept XML
        And I send a GET request to "/api/tweets"
        Then the XML response should have "tweet" with text "Hello World!"

      Scenario: Post tweet using POST-params
        When I send a POST request to "/api/tweets" with the following:
          | tweet | Hello World! |
          | lat   | 42.848282    |
          | lng   | 74.634933    |
        Then the response status should be "201"

      Scenario: Post tweet using json in POST body
        When I send a POST request to "/api/tweets" with the following:
          """
          {"tweet":"Hello World!","lat":"42.848282", "lng":"74.634933"}
          """
        Then the response status should be "201"

      Scenario: Basic authentication
        When I authenticate as the user "joe" with the password "password123"
        And I send a GET request to "/api/tweets"
        Then the response status should be "200"

      Scenario: Digest authentication
        When I digest-authenticate as the user "joe" with the password "password123"
        And I send a GET request to "/api/tweets"
        Then the response status should be "200"
